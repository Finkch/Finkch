## Hey!

I'm Skyler, or Finkch on the interweb. When I have the downtime to code, I toil away at making small game demos, trying to solve difficult math problems, creating physics simulations, playing with data analysis, and doing plenty of toy problems. Beyond those topics, I'm also a big fan of astrophysics, video games, and tabletop roleplaying games. When I want to learn a new language, my goto project is a basic reimplenting of an n-body orbital simulator.


## Cool Projects

If you want to take a look at some of the stuff I've done, here's a quick list:
- [Auto Pixel Art](https://github.com/Finkch/Auto-Pixelart): this is what I'm currently working on! Using intelligent downscaling algorithms to turn a regular image into impressive pixel art.
- [PiByPeople](https://github.com/Finkch/PiByPeople): a project to answer a simple question in a silly way. Estimates π using human generated random numbers and performs a little bit of data analytics to see just bad humans are at being random.
- [Ion Ramjet Simulation (Beta)](https://github.com/Finkch/Ion-Ramjet-Beta) and [Alpha](https://github.com/Finkch/Ion-Ramjet): a WIP physics simulation to determine the effectiveness of an interstellar magnetic scoop ramjet.
- [Magic Square, Squared](https://github.com/Finkch/MagicSquareSquare): trying my hand at a computational approach for a still unsolved maths problem.
- [PICO-64](https://github.com/Finkch/pico-64): a library for the fantasy colose PICO-8 to support 64-bit integer operations rather than its native 16-bit capabilities.
- [Mineswept](https://github.com/Finkch/mineswept): a silly implementation of the classic Minesweeper for the fantasy console PICO-8, except you're guaranteed to lose on the second turn.
- [2023 University Capstone](https://github.com/Finkch/2023-Capstone): a two-semester project required to complete my Computer Science degree. My team and I earned the highest grade out of the class. The project included automatically generating and grading SQL and Relational Algebra (RelaX) question, creating interfaces to accept and execute user input for SQL and RelaX, and maintaining front-to-back testing plus supporting documentation.
